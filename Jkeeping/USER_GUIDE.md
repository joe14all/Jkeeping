## 📊 Understanding Your Dashboard

Once you've added some transactions, your **Home** page will show:

### Your Money
- **Total Revenue**: All payments from practices
- **Business Expenses**: All money you spent on the business
- **Net Profit**: Revenue minus expenses (this is what you have left)

### Tax Savings
- **Tax Savings**: How much money you save by being an S-corp instead of a sole proprietor

### Owner Compensation Strategy
This section tells you:
- **Recommended W-2 Salary**: How much to pay yourself as a "salary" (usually 50% of profit)
- **Distributions**: How much to take as "distributions" (the remaining profit)

**Why does this matter?** As an S-corp, you only pay payroll taxes on your salary, not on distributions. This saves you money!

## 💡 Common Questions

### What's the difference between Income and Expense?
- **Income**: Money coming IN (payments from dental offices)
- **Expense**: Money going OUT (business costs like licenses, insurance, travel)

### What are good business expenses?
Anything you spend money on FOR your business:
- Professional licenses
- Malpractice insurance
- Continuing education courses
- Professional memberships
- Business travel and meals
- Office supplies
- Accounting and legal fees

### What's NOT a business expense?
- Personal groceries
- Personal car maintenance (unless you track business miles separately)
- Family entertainment
- Personal credit card payments

### What's a W-2 Salary?
As an S-corp owner, you're also an employee of your own company. The IRS requires you to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" and take taxes out of it (just like any employee). The rest of your profit can be taken as distributions (which don't have payroll taxes).

### How much should my W-2 salary be?
The app recommends **50% of your net profit** as a starting point. This is a common guideline, but you should confirm with your CPA/accountant for your specific situation.

- Scroll down to the transaction table
- Click the **Edit** button (✏️) on the transaction
- Make your changes and click **Save**

### Should I use this instead of QuickBooks?
This app is designed to be **simpler** than QuickBooks for dental contractors. It focuses on the essentials:

If you need full accounting features (payroll, invoicing, inventory), you'll still need QuickBooks or an accountant.
